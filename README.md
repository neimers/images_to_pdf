# Images to pdf
Simple windows exe (command line utility) using python libraries img2pdf and PyMuPDF to convert a list of images to one PDF with bookmarks.

This software is compiled to a windows exe from python source file(s), the source file(s) and setup file is included in the 'source' folder.  It mostly uses img2pdf and PyMuPDF which are both covered under the GPLv3 license.  Attempted to include the files used in the 'source\dependencies' folder.  Versions as below.
